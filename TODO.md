There's so much to do to make this system fully functional...

- Add unique identifier to each app so that it's easier to go back to previous app screens.
- Figure out how to make it easier to reopen the overlay if it's closed.
- Allow multiple data blocks with multiple targets at once, and set it up so that the system knows it can update the menu bar, etc. too. 
- Move to a more generic design to remove IP issues. IP laws are why we can't have nice things.
- Maybe eventually create a stand alone service?
